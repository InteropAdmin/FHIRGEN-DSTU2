# FHIRPublisherDSTU2
This tool is currently used to build components of HL7FHIR implementation guides as used by NHS Digital in England.

## Constraints
The tool is currently created with many features specifically created to meet NHS Digital requirements. Where possible these can be refctored to make them more universally applicable.

## Future Development ##
The tool is still being developed and changes are exepcted to appear. Initially these will be in "feature" branches.

## Master Branch ##
The master branch will reflect the code currenty used by NHS Digital in their product sets.

> ### Project Genesis
> Note this project was initially based on a published project created by Furore (also on GitHub - https://github.com/furore-fhir/Fhir.Publication )
> This project has extended the project significantly as well as making it work for DSTU2.
